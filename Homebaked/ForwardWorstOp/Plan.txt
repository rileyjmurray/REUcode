Schedule the first job first (as opposed to Monaldo variants, which
schedule the first job last).

Look at the DataCenter with the latest first-available-starting-time.

That DataCenter is the "bottleneck" for this iteration.

... now do what?

mu = bottleneck

ratio = w ./ P(:,mu);
if (idx > 1)
    ratio(scheduled == 1) = Inf;
end
sigma(k) = find((ratio == min(ratio)),1);
